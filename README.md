The Trade File Management System is a platform that allows users to upload trade-related files, store extracted data in a database, and manage file records. 
Users can upload files in various formats such as CSV, Excel, or JSON, and the system processes the data to store it securely. 
The system provides features to update trade records, delete unnecessary files, and search for specific file loads using various filters. 
It ensures security with authentication and role-based access control, allowing only authorized users to make changes.
